Youtube 1.0

This module will let you place your YOutube Video Promo you created. 

If you have installed my codeshare module all you have to do is import the update_strider.sql file

If not, please import the phpvms_strider and edit the YoutubeData.class.php file on line 64 and change the 3 to a 1.


To use this, you will need to get the YOutube video ID from the url, and paste it into the correct field in the add Youtube video

EG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTjGnymiz4A

The last part is the code you need.
